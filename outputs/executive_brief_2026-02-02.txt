1) Executive Summary
This brief summarizes prioritized security signals detected from simulated Sentinel telemetry. The objective is to demonstrate an automation-driven triage workflow that reduces manual review and accelerates response decisions.

2) Exposure Snapshot
- Total Alerts: 4
- Critical: 1 | High: 3

3) Top Alerts (Highest Priority)
- [Critical] Shadow Copy Deletion on FIN-WS-014 | Entity=contoso\jdoe | Score=98
  Recommendation: Isolate host; Contain ransomware; Start IR process
- [High] Suspicious PowerShell from Office App on FIN-WS-014 | Entity=contoso\jdoe | Score=90
  Recommendation: Isolate host; Collect triage package; Hunt similar activity
- [High] Impossible Travel Sign-in on AzureAD | Entity=j.smith@contoso.com | Score=85
  Recommendation: Reset password; Revoke sessions; Review MFA

4) Recommended Actions (Next 24 Hours)
- Contain FIN-WS-014 immediately if shadow copy deletion confirmed; initiate incident response.
- Validate suspicious PowerShell execution chain; hunt across endpoints for similar parent-child process patterns.
- Investigate svc-backup sign-in sequence; enforce MFA and block suspicious IP where applicable.
- Validate user travel for impossible travel alert; revoke sessions if unconfirmed.

5) Notes
This project uses deterministic enrichment and simulated data for demonstration. Extend by connecting to Sentinel API, MDE Advanced Hunting, and automated ticketing.
