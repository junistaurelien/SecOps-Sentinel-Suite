## 📌 Overview
**SecOps Sentinel Suite** is a hands-on security project showcasing **proactive detection engineering** and **security automation** using:

- **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)** for KQL detections + analytics
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (EDR)** for endpoint telemetry + response actions
- **AI-assisted optimization** to reduce noise and improve detection signal

Think: *“SOC analyst workflows—compressed into a portfolio-ready project.”* 🚀

---

## 🎯 Objectives
This project is designed to:

- ✅ Build and tune **custom KQL detection rules**
- ✅ Reduce **false positives** (less noise, more signal)
- ✅ Automate **containment / response logic**
- ✅ Visualize **attack patterns** and security trends via dashboards

---

## 🔍 Use Cases Implemented
Current detection scenarios include:

- **Brute Force Detection** (failed sign-in bursts, threshold logic)
- **Impossible Travel** (geo-velocity / location anomaly patterns)
- **Suspicious Process Execution** (unusual parent-child behavior)
- **Data Exfiltration Indicators** (spikes, unusual destinations, abnormal volume)

---

## 🧠 AI-Augmented Workflow (The Fun Part)
To make detections stronger and cleaner, I used AI to help:

- 🧩 Refactor KQL logic for clarity + efficiency  
- 🎯 Adjust thresholds to reduce alert fatigue  
- 🧪 Validate detection assumptions with edge cases  
- 🧼 Improve signal quality (fewer “meh” alerts, more “oh wow” alerts)

---

## 📈 Security Impact (Simulated)
Key outcomes from the implemented workflows:

- 🔒 Reduced simulated brute-force success paths to **near zero**
- ⚡ Automated isolation triggers for high-confidence endpoint events
- 📊 Faster visibility into threats using dashboards + structured alerting
- 📝 Cleaner documentation for repeatable SOC playbooks
