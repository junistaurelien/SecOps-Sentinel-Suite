# SecOps-Sentinel-Suite

🛡 SecOps Sentinel Suite – AI-Augmented Detection & Response
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates proactive detection engineering and security automation using Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Endpoint.

Designed to simulate real-world SOC workflows with AI-assisted optimization logic.

🎯 Objectives

✔ Engineer custom KQL detection rules
✔ Reduce false positives
✔ Automate containment logic
✔ Visualize attack patterns

🔍 Use Cases Implemented

Brute Force Detection

Impossible Travel

Suspicious Process Execution

Data Exfiltration Indicators

🧠 AI-Augmented Workflow

Detection thresholds were refined using AI-assisted query analysis and logic enhancement to reduce noise and improve signal accuracy.

📈 Security Impact
